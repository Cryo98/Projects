# Auto Reputation Grinder for Super Power Fighting Simulator on Roblox (v1.2)

Allows to record a macro as to auto grind kills and reputation on Super Power Fighting Simulator on Roblox, can work on other games too, but the respawn time can be different.

P.s. this program is not very precise, so maneuvers that require high precision will probably not work.

- Codes:
  - 'Cryo': every 10 kills the character is reset
  - 'Kpscarface': every 50 kills, 'alt+tab' is pressed to switch to a secondary tab, a click is made, and then 'alt+tab' is pressed again to get back to the previous tab

- Controls:
  - '<':                Start/stop macro recording 'or' starts the macro
  - 'ctrl + P':                             Pause
  - 'ctrl + R' (when paused):              Resume
  - 'ctrl + C':           Record a new macro (overrides the old one)
  - 'esc':                                  Exit
